            Back when I was a whole other person ago, before the weight of mortgages, 9-5's and saving for retirement 
            weighed me down, I had one of those experiences. The kind that fills your stomach with butterflies and leaves
            a smile lingering on your face. The kind that feels like a dream you don't want to wake up from because as soon
            as you do, the memory slips away like sand cascading through your fingers. That was my experience when I traveled
            to South Africa in order to gain my Field Guide Certification, complete some conservation work and explore the 
            country. The following highight a few of the highlights from my trip. You just had to be there. 
         </p>
         <p>
         First, in order to be an engaging and knowledgeable safari guide, I embarked on a rigorous study program.
         I had to obtain my Field Guide Certification through the Field Guide Association of Southern Africa (FGASA).
         This consisted of a riveting text full of information on animals, plants, constellations, and ways to enhance 
         guest experiences by incorporating hands-on, sensory components to a tour. Little did I know, one of my "sensory experiences"
         would be an escaped caracal approaching my tour group. All he did was act like a house cat and rub against the legs 
         of the guests. We got him safely back in his habitat after he received lots of attention.

         Next, conservation was a large focus for the training. This consisted of following a vet who would have to tranquilize a 
         half ton sable antelope, with two large, very pointy horns. Once the eland was down, I administered a shot of medicine 
         to help the preganant eland. After, she leapt off into the bush. We also spent a day in the middle of a bunch of elephant 
         dung and surrounded by thorny acacia trees as we performed habitat maintenance. This helped rid invasive species and provide
      easier access for the giraffes to the delicious acacia trees. Speaking of giraffes, the reserve had a resident giraffe, Ayana, 
      who was an orphaned newborn. She would walk around the reserve getting pets and hugs from guests and employees. 
      She was raised along side a dog named Milo, a meerkat and two warthogs. Sometimes it really felt like the set of Lion King.

      However, the best part of training was observing other guides by riding along on their tours, or just going out with other guides. To 
      see these incredible animals in their native habitat, free to roam and be the wild, majestic creatures they are, was inspiring. From 
      elephants tickling each other with their trunks, to a giant hippo yawn, to driving into the lion habitat to place some treats 
      (which consisted of driving really fast to get some clearance from the lions as they are chasing the treat mobile, jumping out the truck 
      and grabbing a slab of meat to throw down before scrabbling back in the truck), to seeing a cheetah hunt, to seeing the ragtag group of 
      bachelor males who were kicked out of their groups to start their own mismatched herd. The mismatched herd consisted of two zebras, 
      a wildebeest and two giraffes. Surprisingly, despite narrowly escaping a honey badger encounter, almost being pecked in the face by a 
      penguin and being chased by lions, the meanest animal in all of Africa was a giant tortoise I was just trying to get my picture with.

   <h1> Next Adventure</h1>
   <p>
      After working as a Safari Guide during the busy season, it was time to start my next adventure, not knowing yet what it would be. 
      Somehow, this next adventure was volunteering at a brewery in Stellenbosch, South Africa's wine country. My accomadation was in 
      the library of a home built in 1756 in the middle of the vineyard. I don't know how, but the owner of the brewery gave me 
      the keys to his BMW to get back and forth the brewery safely. In addition to learning about the brew process, I made a few close friends, 
      some of which I still keep in contact with today.

   <h1> What Now?</h1>
   <p>
      In conclusion, my time in South Africa is something I will never forget. The people were warm and welcoming, I learned how to be confident on my own and rise to unexpected challenges and I had the 
      wonderful experience of seeing wild animals in their wild habitats. This trip provided me tools for the future. I seek new opportunities such as learning to code (or attempting to) and taking a 
      chance on something entirely out of my comfort zone. I'll admit I'd rather be handling live pythons than learning how to code python, but I look forward to what sort of adventures my 
      LaunchCode journey will take me on. Onward!
